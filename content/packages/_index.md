 As a service to the community, and for my own personal purposes I maintain several software repositories for Alpine Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, and Docker.

- __TRANSPARENCY:__ Build scripts are stored on Github, and built automatically by TravisCI. Automatic build processes and public build logs provide full insight into what goes into compiled software.
- __INTEROPABILITY:__ Packages are cross compiled to work exactly the same across multiple platforms. Develop with Docker, then deploy to Ubuntu, RedHat, or CentOS and be guaranteed that software packages and versions will work exactly the same.
- __RELIABLE UPDATES:__ Updates and security patches are regularly applied and made available on all platforms at the same time.
