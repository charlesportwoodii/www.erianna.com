Making material lists for Minecraft Bedrock edition is hard, so I made a tool written in rust that'll take an exported .mcstructure file and conver it into a very simple materials list for you to use for your videos.

Checkout this Youtube Short that showcases how to use it. You can get more information about the tool from Github: https://github.com/Alaydriem/bedrock-material-list
